# odin-recipes
This is a first approach to putting html in practice, 
in it I made an attempt to build a website with 3 recipes
following The Odin Project directions.

I used three of my favorite recipes: Stir-fry, Patacones and Smoothie.

In the website, where it says "Ingredience" is a joke, a reference to a 
Tumblr post I found funny. I am aware it's "Ingredients" and I'm aware 
that in a professional setting it may be more responsible to use
"Ingredients."
